## How to setup/deploy.

### Read these notes carefully before proceeding 
 - Your code must be open source and a link to your fork's repository must be there in the start reply of the bot.

  <summary>Steps to deploy on Heroku !!</summary>

```
Fill in all the details, Deploy!
Now go to https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/(app-name)/resources ( Replace (app-name) with your app name )
REMEMBER: Turn on worker dyno (Don't worry It's free :D) & Webhook
Now send the bot /start, If it doesn't respond go to https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/(app-name)/settings and remove webhook and port.
